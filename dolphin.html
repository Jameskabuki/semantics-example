            <h3 id="dolphintwo"><i> General Characteristics</i></h3>
            <section style="color: black; align-items: center; background-color: aqua;"> Dolphins are  toothed whales belonging to the mammal family Delphinidae (oceanic dolphins) as well as the families Platanistidae and Iniidae, the two that contain the river dolphins. Of the nearly 40 species of dolphins in the Delphinidae, 6 are commonly called whales, including the killer whale and the pilot whales. The name dolphin is also applied to members of the fish genus Coryphaena (family Coryphaenidae).</section>
            <h3 id="dolphinthree"> <i> Conservation Status</i></h3>
            <section style="color: black; align-items: center; background-color: aqua; display: flex;"> Information regarding current population levels and trends remains elusive for many dolphin species. Although bottlenose dolphins are species of least concern, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), several dolphins are at risk of extinction. Dolphin species that the IUCN considers vulnerable or near threatened include the Indo-Pacific humpbacked dolphin (Sousa chinensis), the Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris), and the Australian snubfin dolphin (O. heinsohni). The most vulnerable dolphins include the Ganges river dolphin (Platanista gangetica) and the Indus river dolphin (P. minor), which are classified as endangered species, and the Atlantic humpbacked dolphin (Sousa teuszii), which is classified as critically endangered.</section>
            <h3 id="dolphinfour"> <i> Paleontology and classification</i></h3>
            <section style="color: black; align-items: center; background-color: aqua; display: flex;">Dolphins first appear as fossils from the Early Miocene Epoch (23 million to 16 million years ago)—a time when the cetacean fauna was more diverse. All of today’s dolphin groups were present in the Miocene, as were at least three extinct families whose members would be called dolphins (Eurhinodelphidae, Hemisyntrachelidae, and Acrodelphidae).</section>
